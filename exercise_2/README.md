# Pros & cons for using a single page web app

## Pros
* Dynamic & fast. Not waiting for slow page refresh
* More responsive experience (eg. inline editting)
* Smarter experience (eg. search suggestions)

## Cons 
* SEO, when everything is Javascript a crawler sees nothing. (Used to be, isomorphic is piece of cake now)
* Overkill for a really simple websites.
* Progressive enhancement, it's a lot of work to build a SPA that works for browser without/disabled Javascript.
