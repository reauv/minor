# Pros & cons for the usage of Javascript libraries/frameworks

## Pros
#### Don't reinvent the wheel (If you don't use a framework, you write one)
With a framework you can focus on your domain logic and you don't have to worry about a lot of general stuff (DRY)
#### High code quality, often tested & maintained by experienced developers
Most frameworks have tests and lot of time and effort put in to. Therefore there is a high code quality.
#### Less development time & more sanity
Not reinventing the wheel saves a lot of time and keeps the developer sane ;-)
#### Opinionated, best practices.
Developers with a lot of experience and skills are working on frameworks so they are using best practices you should learn from as a beginning web developer.
Most frameworks also enforce some kind of best practive. Like React that enforces using a single source of truth and not use two way databinding.

## Cons
#### Performance overhead
A framework is extra code, so it comes at a cost. If you want to make the comparison you have to mind that if you don't use a framework you'll end up writing a lot more code yourselves. In some cases that can even mean a larger codebase than if you would have used a framework, this depends ofcourse on the scale of your application.
#### Black box, no idea what's going on.
Most people that use a a framework have no idea what's going on inside and therefore they do not really learn their language and find themselves having a hard time debugging
#### Swiss knife, only need one part of a (big) framework
A lot of people use jQuery only for the selectors, but you are also pulling in a lot of other stuff you are not using.
#### Javascript fatigue
By choosing for React for example you also choose to use a lot of other stuff like ES6, JSX, transpilers & build tools etc.
They are not really necessary but the community and all the guides & tutorials expect you to use a complicated stack, so getting support without using that stack is hard.
